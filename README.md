# Random Color Genetor

## Objective

#### I created a random generated colors using HTML,CSS and JS. I wanted to create a project that would allow me to practice my JS.

## Improvements

#### Some thing I would like to work on this project are:
    - Making a shadow overlay appear when a mouse hovers over a color.
    - Implamenting a working day and night theme button.
    - Adding the ability to copy the rgb number onto clipboard.
